PALMYRA PLLC is a woman-owned full-service research-based and design-focused architecture practice based in Chicago.
          <span style="vertical-align:-50%"> </span><br>
        The practice, like its founder, is named after the city of Palmyra in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria, a city with an independent streak and an incredibly rich multicultural history. The archaeological site of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was partially destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Even in its ruinous state, Palmyra is a palimpsest, if there ever was any. In our practice we believe that we are never creating in a vacuum and the name of our practice serves as a reminder of that.

        </h6></b>
      </p>
      </h6></b>
      <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 11px; "> 
        Architecture always starts with a problem: sometimes an eminently practical one and sometimes an abstract or conceptual one. Any formal or aesthetic merits a project achieves become meaningful only when the project has met and exceeded the purpose it was intended to serve.
        <span style="vertical-align:-50%"> </span><br>        
        Beyond the clinical joy of problem-solving there is also something deeply rewarding to the process of listening to the needs and desires of a client/end user and helping them realize their vision by infusing it with the spatial thinking, holistic planning, and technical expertise only an architect can provide. Architecture, after all, is a deeply humanistic endeavor, one that requires empathy, conviction, and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, the knowledge that comes with inhabiting a problem, internalizing its limitations, and making the judgment calls that ultimately lead to its solution.
        <span style="vertical-align:-50%"> </span><br>        
        In our work we strive to adopt this exacting but empathic approach to design.
