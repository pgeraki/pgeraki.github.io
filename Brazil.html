      <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 11px; ">
         Brazil is a place of myth-making and the subject of much mythology as well. </p>
         Ever since I was introduced to Brazilian architecture I began to see Brazil as the locus of an alternative approach to the stark dualities of local vs global, center vs margins, new vs old, tradition vs modernity. Its long-standing European colonial tradition, its abundant natural resources, its remarkable topography, its racial and cultural diversity, its rampant socioeconomic inequalities and its dubious state of development make Brazil a Janus-faced gem. Uniquely situated at a crossroads, Brazil is a country where utopias and shattered dreams, dystopias and seductive realities can coexist almost without conflict. </p>
         Brasília, Brazil’s miraculously conjured capital, captures the imagination as the ultimate testament to Brazil’s transformative capacity. Built in forty one months between 1956 and 1960 during Juscelino Kubitschek’s presidential administration, Brasília not only delivered the promise of ‘Fifty Years of Progress in Five’ but was also the incarnation of an old Brazilian dream of an inland capital. As Guilio Carlo Argan suggests, “Brazil became modern almost instantaneously and without any questioning of, or distancing from, the process. Modernity occurred, it could be said, without any accompanying cultural sedimentation.” </p>
         Brasília represents a triumph of political vision and willpower, a utopia turned into reality: that is the city’s lasting legacy. It is in this light that this exhibit reexamines the Brasília competition. Announced in September 1956, the competition gave designers the opportunity to test the full range of the ideals of the Modern Movement at an unprecedented scale and within the realm of possibility. The program of the new national capital called for a comprehensive vision for the modern city, ranging from the quotidian to the monumental. The schemes that are shown here, envisioned by some of the most prominent Brazilian architects of that generation, are as much part of the history of Brasília as the Lúcio Costa plan that was eventually built. They represent alternate realities that could only coexist with the city’s current form in a land of infinite possibility such as Brazil.
