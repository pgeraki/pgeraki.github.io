                    Lower Allston Landing, currently owned by Harvard University, is the site of a now defunct CSX rail yard, the Houghton Chemical Company, and left-over spaces of a major interchange of the Massachusetts Turnpike. The redevelopment of such a challenging site requires a synergy of infrastucture, programmatic adjacencies as well as place-making. Issues under scrutiny include: urban density, the campus typology, convention and typological innovation, the customization of the ground plane, and sustainability.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                    This proposal treats the highway as a barrier and divides the site into two parts with distinct programmatic and formal characteristics: a closed R&D campus on the Southern part of the site, and a residential campus along the Charles River. The distinction between public and private is constantly called into question through planimetric and sectional moves that introduce unlikely adjacencies and crossovers.
