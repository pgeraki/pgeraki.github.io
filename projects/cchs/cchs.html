                    By offering multiple connections to the outdoors and a wide variety of spatial experiences that can support activity and togetherness as well as intimacy and solitude, "After Hours" transforms an existing high school cafeteria and auditorium lobby into a new hub of student activity that can foster socialization and encourage disengagement from digital devices and social media as a way to promote student mental health. <br>
                    <br>
                    This project comprises three distinct but connected areas of intervention: the Performing Arts Atrium and Student Center, both of which feature extenstive renovations of existing spaces alongside two new building additions, and the Courtyad, which includes a three-season room and activity-oriented landscaping. All of these spaces will remain open after hours for students to enjoy, becoming not only the social heartbeat of the campus but also a place of community.<br>
