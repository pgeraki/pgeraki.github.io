                    PALMYRA was invited to participate in the 2024 edition of the <a href='https://www.chicagosukkahfestival.org/'>Chicago Sukkah Design Festival</a>, which is rapidly becoming an institution in Chicago's North Lanwdale neighborhood bringing together Chicago-based designers and community organizations.

                    In collaboration with Jordan Campbell of <a href='https://www.altspacechicago.com/about'>[alt_]</a>, we worked with <a href='https://www.open-books.org/stores/northlawndale/'>Open Books North Lawndale</a> and the <a href='https://www.chicagochildrensmuseum.org/'>Chicago Children's Museum</a> in their role as stewards of the <a href='https://playfullearninglandscapes.com/'>Playful Learning Landscapes</a> nationwide initiative.

                    Let's meet by the "book"! This sukkah is a haven, an inspiration, a playscape, and a landmark for the North Lawndale neighborhood and, especially, its children and their caregivers. By evoking weightlessness - book pages floating in midair - the sukkah design embodies the idea that reading transports the reader to another world and emphasizes Open Books' belief that reading can happen anywhere at any time. After the estival, the sukkah will relocate to 16th Street near Hamlin Avenue, on a site that's part of the Resilient Corridors Project. In addition to the sukkah, the site will also host a <a href="https://playfullearninglandscapes.com/">Playful Learning Landscape</a> installation focused on nature, water, word play, and conservation.

                    Playful Learning Landscapes is a nationwide initiative that transforms everyday public spaces into joyful learning opportunities. Together, the site interventions aim to define and activate a welcoming, pursposeful hub for local residents to foster care and connection to each other and to their public spaces.
