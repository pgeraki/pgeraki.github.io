                    This interior renovation reconfigures the entry, living, dining, and kitchen areas of an apartment in Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood into an exquisitely idiosyncratic constellation of intimate and highly textured spaces populated by an eclectic collection of objects from around the world.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                    By taking away some space from one of the unit's bedrooms, the design creates an intimate dining nook opposite the bay window. The intimacy of both nooks is emphasized further by the ring of arches that defines the main living space.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                    The kitchen has also been reconfigured to open towards the living room symmetrically through two archways flanking the island. The doubling of the archways around the island creates an effect of reverberating curvatures and constant reframing of every view around this rather small space. </div>
