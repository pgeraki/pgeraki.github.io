          The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra is a youth orchestra consisting of musicians from countries in the Middle East. Founded in 1999 by Daniel Barenboim and the late Edward Said, the orchestra was conceived as a "project against ignorance." Music, the singular thing that the orchestra's members have in common when they first join, brings together people from diverse backgrounds and forces them to encounter and experience the Other.

          The following proposal for the new home of the West-Eastern Divan in Istanbul, Turkey, concentrates on the concert hall as the locusof the orchestra's social function â€” internal and external. The symphonic performance becomes the vehicle of social transformation. The shoebox and vineyard typologies are combined to create a unique morphological outcome that provides for an intimate yet majestic, acoustically sound musical experience both for the audience and the orchestra members themselves.

        From an urban point of view, the West-Eastern Divan complex has a two-fold function on the site. On the pedestrian side the theatricality of the interior is reflected on the exterior: the architectural object is showcased as a jewel draped in a lavish enclosure. On the side facing the speedway, the jewel is encased in several layers of enclosure and can only be partially perceived by the moving observer.
