                         The practice, like its founder, is named after the city of Palmyra in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria, a city with an independent streak and an incredibly rich multicultural history. The archaeological site of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was partially destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Even in its ruinous state, Palmyra is a palimpsest, if there ever was any. In our practice we believe that we are never creating in a vacuum and the name of our practice serves as a reminder of that.

                         Architecture always starts with a problem: sometimes an eminently practical one and sometimes an abstract or conceptual one. <!--Any formal or aesthetic merits a project achieves become meaningful only when the project has met and exceeded the purpose it was intended to serve.

                         Beyond the clinical joy of problem-solving there is also something deeply rewarding to the process of listening to the needs and desires of a client/end user and helping them realize their vision by infusing it with the spatial thinking, holistic planning, and technical expertise only an architect can provide. Architecture, after all, is a deeply humanistic endeavor, one that requires empathy, conviction, and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, the knowledge that comes with inhabiting a problem, internalizing its limitations, and making the judgment calls that ultimately lead to its solution.

                    <b> Project Description: </b> The master plan for this project, redesigned several times through the years to better align with existing urban axes and corridors, responded to complex site conditions and calls from local preservationists by preserving the existing Century Plaza hotel on site. Currently under construction, the twin residential towers of the new Century Plaza development complete the axis created by Minoru Yamasaki’s iconic twin towers and historic crescentshaped hotel as well as Gensler’s more recent 2000 Avenue of the Stars.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        The 1-million-square-foot new development, which includes two residential towers with condominium units, amenities, restaurants, retail space, landscaped parks, plazas, and onsite parking, involved a team of four architectural offices, an interior design firm, and over thirty consultants, sub-contractors, and specialized owner's representatives. Overlapping scopes of work and a shift to a design-build during Design Development rendered the process of coordination difficult but ultimtaely rewarding.
