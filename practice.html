                         PRACTICE
                     </div>
                     <div class="paragraph practice-left">
                         PALMYRA PLLC is a woman-owned WBE-certified full-service architecture practice based in Chicago.
                     </div>
                     <div class="paragraph practice-left">
                         The practice, like its founder, is named after the city of Palmyra in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria, a city with an independent streak and an incredibly rich multicultural history. The archaeological site of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was partially destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Even in its ruinous state, Palmyra is a palimpsest, if there ever was any. In our practice we believe that we are never creating in a vacuum and the name of our practice serves as a reminder of that.

                         PHILOSOPHY
                     </div>
                     <div class="paragraph practice-left">
                         Architecture always starts with a problem: sometimes an eminently practical one and sometimes an abstract or conceptual one. Any formal or aesthetic merits a project achieves become meaningful only when the project has met and exceeded the purpose it was intended to serve.           
                     </div>
                     <div class="paragraph practice-left">
                         Beyond the clinical joy of problem-solving there is also something deeply rewarding to the process of listening to the needs and desires of a client/end user and helping them realize their vision by infusing it with the spatial thinking, holistic planning, and technical expertise only an architect can provide. Architecture, after all, is a deeply humanistic endeavor, one that requires empathy, conviction, and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, the knowledge that comes with inhabiting a problem, internalizing its limitations, and making the judgment calls that ultimately lead to its solution.                     
                     </div>
                     <div class="paragraph practice-left">  
                         In our work we strive to adopt this exacting but empathic approach to design.
